# Practice-Projects
projects to keep myself busy

This is a collection of projects created to simply output a visual representation of the practice completed during down time.

Each piece is not a full website but moreover a component to use later in future projects.

All projects in this repository are composed of simply HTML5, CSS3, and ES9.
